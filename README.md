# Forex-Machine-Learning

This honors project studies possible trading strategies in the foreign exchange (Forex) market by examining the price and volatility behaviors in trading data using machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. Machine learning may be applied in this situation due to its unique ability to analyze large amount of data and recognize patterns. It also has the ability to improve through experience, which allows for flexibility in changing conditions. A challenge of this project is to balance prediction accuracy with computational feasibility. Researchers have used machine learning strategies such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Support Vector Regression (SVR), or even string theory towards the financial markets. I will attempt to replicate the SGD model and calculate the accuracy and return on investment of the outputted strategy in the context of transaction prices and constraints on supply and demand.
